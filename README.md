# _Cuộc Chở Âm_: <sup>`sound transport`</sup><sub><sub><sub> for _fun_ </sub></sub></sub>and <sup><sup><sup> ~~_profit_~~<sub><sub><sub> learning.</sub></sub></sub></sup></sup></sup>

## What is it?

This project aims at building, from scratch:
* an RTL model of a sound card that communicates with the host via ethernet and with off-board DACs and ADCs via S/PDIF
* a linux kernel module that supports the card as an ALSA-compliant device
